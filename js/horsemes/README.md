Motivation
----------

One day, I saw a cool and attractive horse image from [a luxury company homepage](https://www.hermes.com/).
The horse was just a loading indicator, but it reminded me a retro graphic of old days, decades ago. So I decided to make a game with it.

The homepage has total six horse GIF images for each situation.

Obstacles
---------

All obstacle images came from [the homepage](https://www.hermes.com/).


Note
----

This game loads all assets directly from [their homepage](https://www.hermes.com/) not to make any trouble.
I'd tried to make a bare-bone, thin and small code. No external libraries are used.
